# BeanExplorer 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DevelopmentOnTheEdge/beanexplorer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DevelopmentOnTheEdge/beanexplorer) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/DevelopmentOnTheEdge/beanexplorer/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/DevelopmentOnTheEdge/beanexplorer?branch=master)

BeanExplorer supplies to the developer powerful Property Inspectors that significantly reduce number of dialogs and other UI elements (or eliminate dialogs at all). 
This makes your application interface modern and consistent.

Developers can implement beans using either basic mechanism provided by JavaBeans technology or using advanced mechanism called BeanHelpers.

With BeanHelpers a developer can define backward compatible JavaBeans that will have many advanced features when they are used with BeanExplorer tools like "classic", dialog and tabular Property inspectors.

This extension in conjunction with BeanExplorer's PropertyInspectors is used to build applications with sophisticated interfaces.

Specifically the extension allows the developer to:
* Specify order of the properties in Property Inspectors.
* Change behavior of the properties at runtime.
* Define advanced editors to change values of the properties.
* Add and remove properties dynamically usin DynamicProperty concept.
